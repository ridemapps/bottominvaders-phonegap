# Bottom Invaders: Phonegap wrapped PhaserJS game
Uses Phaser JS Engine wrapped in Phonegap deployed on Android and iOS.
Consists of two folders:
- PureJS, a version which is used for Dev of the sample app itself
- PhoneGap, which will 'eventually' contain the wrapped game.

As dev continues, the PureJS folder will be combined into PhoneGap and removed. It exists for more convenient early dev only.

Builds will be from PhoneGap folder.
